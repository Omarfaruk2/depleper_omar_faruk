            <p>When looking for a plan, most people already have an idea of the domain or domains they want and what
                they want the end-websites or websites to look like. Once, only computer programmers who had a strong
                grasp of computer code were able to build and develop websites, but today there are a myriad of
                different software.

                <P>Keeping in touch with family and friends: Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with your family
                    and
                    friends that live far away. With instant messaging and even video chat, Facebook is the perfect
                    environment to stay connected. With the status updates, photos, and profile information, it can keep
                    you
                    up to date on the happenings of all of your close ones.</P>

                <H2>IN 2004-2022</H2>
                <P>Cyberbullying: On Facebook, it is very easy for cyberbullies to thrive. They can harass and/or gang
                    up on
                    one person even easier than they could in a school environment. There aren't moderators that go
                    around
                    monitoring what people say to each other. Anything can be said. There are also a relatively small
                    amount
